<!-- //so when we write queryselall..in case of unordered list that is mentioned in program node list comes thats not an array dont confuse it by thuinking
that it has for each in its properties..arrays do have maps..there are no maps in that node list -->

<!-- we have to write it as inorder to apply css style to it
const tempLiList = document.queryselectorall('li')
templilist[0].style.green  -->
<!-- it applies to all things whereevr query selector all is applied....for each can also be applied here
use for each on node list to treat it as an array 
for each on  node list as 
li.foreach(function(i){
    i.style.color='green'
})
to use node list as an array we have to convert it...as explained before in order for for each to work

similarly, html collection needs also to be converted to in order for for in loop to work via Array.from 
Array.from(tempClass)
